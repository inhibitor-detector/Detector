currently your environment has an object called "d" for dongle.  this is how 
you interact with the rfcat dongle:
    >>> d.ping()
    >>> d.setFreq(433000000)
    >>> d.setMdmModulation(MOD_ASK_OOK)
    >>> d.makePktFLEN(250)
    >>> d.RFxmit(b"HALLO")
    >>> d.RFrecv()
    >>> print(d.reprRadioConfig())
